					<p class="caption">You may have noticed that the name of the client here, “Trail's End Rehabilitation and Retirement Farm,” is just a pseudonym; however, to make sure that the design could properly prompt this kind of business, I almost granted myself a <span class="strikethrough">excuse<span> holiday dedicated for horse riding. </p>
					<p>By the way, You are invited to take this little quiz, after looking at the brochure carefully: </p>
					<p>When designing this brochure, I was thinking like a horse, who was recognized by his peer horses as an expert in Science of Food Preservation. So, please tell which of the brochure’s panels are outside and which are inside. </p>

					<p class="caption">This was also an assignment of the Documentat Design course. The newsletter covers were designed as part of the newsletter for the Humanities Department of IIT, 2010 spring version. It was designed through the collaboration of four students.</p>

					<br />
					<img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2291825/IPRO_brocure.JPG" alt="Click the title above to download file" />
					<p class="caption">IPRO day is the showtime for tens of IIT student teams, who have spent 4-5 months working on their Inter-Professional projects. It is surely a festivity for document designers, too! At the exhibition booths with brochures and posters flying around, they can enjoy handing out or hanging up their masterpieces, and can indulge themselves with appreciating or criticizing what others have crafted. </p>
					<p>Here are what my team used for showcasing our consulting work with Sloan Valve Company. I was so much honored to be given the task of designing both the poster and the brochure; also, to my great pleasure, our presentation won the highest score among 5 teams in the same track. </p>

				<li id="poster">
					<a class="pf_entry" href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2291825/Poster_IPRO306.pdf">Poster for demonstrating project results <span class="file_type">PDF file</span></a>
					<br />
					<img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2291825/IPRO_poster.JPG" alt="Click the title above to download file" />
					<p class="caption">This was a fierce battle: a skirmish among four tough troops, each consisted of four IIT students who were equipped with the latest theories and technologies in document design. All endeavored to win the chance of having their design accepted as part of IIT Humanities Department’s Newsletter, Spring/Summer 2010 issue. At the end, my team won! </p>
					<p>Here is what we designed: the front, second, and the end page of the newsletter. </p>

					<a class="pf_entry" href="#">Poster and registration form for a seminar<span class="file_type">PDF file</span></a>
					<br />
					<img src="#" alt="Click the title above to download file" />
					<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2291825/Poster_Financial_Seminar.pdf"></a>
					<p class="caption">I designed this poster to advertise a seminar held on IIT campus.</p>
					<p>Later, I made a twin brother for him: <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dDR2ZFBLY3NlT3Y3eGRKS25GSnhoZGc6MQ">a Google form for people to register online for the seminar</a>. </p>
					<p>The event's attendance was rather satisfying. I hope that most attendees were attracted by the visual pleasure of the poster and the usability of the registration form, rather than the free food.</p>
