			<div>
				<h2>About Cong Sun</h2>
				<p>After receiving his bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering in 2005, Cong got a perfect chance to combine his engineering skills with his interests in editing and designing: he became one of the first batch of information architects in China, working for <a href="http://www.citec.com" title="Cong's photo is on the homepage...He is the guy in white shirt and blue tie">a Finnish company</a> in Hangzhou, a city with beautiful lakes and mountains. </p>
				<p>In 2009, to advance his career, </p>
				<p><strike>he made a trip which almost circled the world within half a year.</strike> </p>
				<p class="notation">(Oops, this above appears to be a typical bad example in terms of technical writing: true statement, but tending to exaggerate.) </p>
				<p>he relocated to work in the company's office in Tampere, Finland, a city with amazing sights of aurora (well, yes, the winter nights are long and dark enough there). When the "polar day" came in the summer and the chance to see the aurora greatly reduced, he accepted the offer from Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, US, and went on another journey to pursue a Master's degree in Technical Communication and Information Design. </p>
				<p>Compared with the aurora, the colors of trees and flowers in autumn Chicago is no less amazing. Moreover, the world of Adobe InDesign and Photoshop, xhtml, CSS, and Ruby on Rails, which Cong immersed himself in during the two-year study since autumn 2009, are absolutely awesome. </p>
				<p>This all makes him a more avid explorer, in both the physical and the digital worlds. </p>

				<h2>Also, about this Web site</h2>
				<p>All right...Finally I find a place to use the word "I" instead of "He." Admittedly, it feels a bit weird to use "He" when writing about oneself; however, I appreciate my Web site's warm-heartedness to speak for me, so that I am happy to let her (or him) do most of the talk. </p>
				<p>This Web site is part of my portfolio. At the beginning I coded it using XHTML, CSS, and jQuery; later I put in also some HTML5 and CSS3. </p>
				<p>I would say that I am currently only a novice user of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, having used them for only half a year. I am confident that I can become a Web coding ninja rather soon if needed, but my interest is more about designing products for optimal usability.</p>
				<p>This above would explain the bland taste of this Web site: my starting point was to make its appearance low key while ensuring its accessibility and usability. Aesthetics will be definitely something I will continue working on; however, my ultimate goal in the layout aspect, for sure, will be guiding the audience to allocate their mental energy properly on different pieces of information. </p>
